The data used in the 2003 report "ISPRS Comparison of Filters" is presented
here to aid in the development and testing of PDAL-based filters. For more on
the data and the study itself, please see
http://www.itc.nl/isprswgIII-3/filtertest/ and the results of the test as
published in

Sithole, G. and Vosselman, G. (2004) Experimental comparison of filter
algorithms for bare - earth extraction from airborne laser scanning point
clouds. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 59 (1-2), 85-101.

The data in this directory has been altered from its original form.

Specifically, the test data for each of the eight sites has been projected into
UTM zone 32U and converted from ASCII to LAZ. The data contain first and last
returns.

For the reference datasets, the data has once again been projected into UTM
zone 32U and converted from ASCII to LAZ. The data contain no return
information, but ground returns apply the LAS "Ground" classification (all
others are "Created, never classified").
